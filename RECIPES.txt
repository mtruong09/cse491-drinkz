How to Bulk Load Recipes

1. Create a new text file
2. Each line in the file represents a new recipe. The line should be formatted as such:

name of the recipe,ingredient1,ingredient1 amount,ingredient2,ingredient2 amount


The following are examples of correctly formatted recipes:

scotch on the rocks,blended scotch,6 oz,
vomit inducing martini,orange juice,6 oz,vermouth,6 oz

3. Navigate to the /bin directory and run: 'python2.7
load-bulk-recipes %textfileyoucreated'
